# Big-Data-Programming
This repository contains my code for programming models that perform scalable data analytics and discovery tasks over massive and high dimensional datasets. This includes the use of things like Spark programming, Scala programming, MapReduce, Futures, and Dask Delayed to deal with big data. 

Each folder contains a READ_ME.txt file that explains the purpose of the programs. All of my code also contains detailed comments explaining what each line in each program does.
